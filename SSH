  SSH ( Secure Shell ) 
  
  
   1. What is ?
     
      SSH is  network communication protocoll that enables two device/computer to communicate  & share data 
      
      It is called securre shell because the communication between host & client is in encrypted form 
      
      The default port for ssh client communication is 22, we can change  default port
      & use one between 1024 - 32,767 
      
      SSH is also a command in linux 
      
      It is also used to access another linux server  OR accessing a linux server through linux terminal 
      
      syntax - ssh user@host(IP/domain)  ( user should be in present in server )
      
      
   2. How to use ssh ? 
     
       To use ssh , ssh service must be install on linux server 
      
      Check if it is present ?
       
       dpkg -l | grep ssh   
              OR 
       check file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
                 
    3. Install ?
    
       install openssh-clients openssh-server 
       
    4. Enable 
     
       sudo systemctl status ssh   - if disable-
       
    5. To start the SSH service manually, you can run:

        - sudo systemctl start ssh
        
    6.If you want the SSH service to start automatically at boot, you can enable it with:

        - sudo systemctl enable ssh
        
        
      
     * Accessing linux server from another server ( accessing other linux os using another os )
      
       - First user has been  created to another server u wanted to access 
       - ssh user@ip 
       
       Eg: Accesing Kali linux from ubuntu 
           
           simply in kali type ipconfig to get ip address
           now in ubuntu type ssh kali@IP
           So here u need to enter password for eveytime when u want to login in ubuntu as kali 
           if u want not to enter password again & again  
            
            - Generate a new ssh key pair in local machine  - type in ubuntu- ssh-keygen (ls .ssh to verify that generated file) 
            - copy that public key in remote machine 
            - login to remote server without password  - type in ubuntu - ssh-copy-id kali@IP ( it will sk password at once to confirm )
            
             -
