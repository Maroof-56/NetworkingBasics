   LAN (Below 3 things inlcude inside lan)
   
   IP
    - U know that
   
   
   Subnet
    - it is not the ip addr it may look like ip 
    - define the overall range for particular LAN
    - How subnet knows that particular device in its range ?
      - The IP initial numbers decide 
        Eg: 198.12.30  ,  198.12.7.5 
            198 & 12 tells that it from same network
            
            
    Router 
     
    -  Router is the gateway that communicate with outside internet 
    -  Gateway is nothing but IP of an Router
    -  While communnicate with outer area netwwork router didnt expose ip of inside device 
    
    
    
    
    
    1. Ping (Packet internet groper ) 
    
      - What ping command can do 
       
        - Check network connectivity ( check that can we connect to server)
        - check internet connection 
        - check network interface card 
        - check latency on network 
        - DNS resolution 
        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
     - PING FOR NETWORK CONNECTIVITY 
        
      - For Successful Connection 
        
        - 100% packet recieve  ( Connected throgh icmp  -  internet control message protocol)
        - 100% packet loss  ( Not connected ) 
        - Request timeout for icmp  ( Not connected ) 
        - Destination host unreachable ( Not Connected ) 
        
      - Reason for not connection 
      
        - Firewall
         
          - Firewall not allowed you to connect 
          - 
          
        - Server is down 
        
        - Problem from your side 
          
          - Not Connected with internet 
          - Hardware issue 
          - Router issue
          
          
        - 50 % Packet loss
         
          - Network Traffic
          
          
   - PING FOR DNS RESOLUTION 
   
      - Command 
      
        - ping hostname 
        - ping ip 
        - ping -c 3 ( for three time packet )
        - ping -i 2 ( for time interval of 2 sec )
        - ping -c 5 -q ( This will give only summary ) 
        - ping -f ( This will send packet as fast as possible to check network performance) 
        - ping -s 500 ( To change the size of packet )
        - ping -w 10 (To stop printing after 10 sec ) 
        - ping -a ( generate sound on each packet ) 
        -

   2. Traceroute 
   
         Track the route packet on how data travel on internet from your computer to destination.
         
         The only parameter is required is name or ip of destination host.
         
         When we sending packet from serverA to B then in between there are lots of Routers available 
         Routers can create problem to reached
         
         Traceroute  is not default available in system , it need oto be install
         
         sudo apt install traceroute
         
         
      - tarceroute www.google.com
      
        - Give u the info how it reach to destination
        - Hops ( Number of routers available or present in between ) 
        
      - Commands 
      
        - traceroute  ip 100 ( BY default package sent rate is 60 u can change)
        - traceroute -q 1 ip ( Default no of packet per hops is 3 to change it use this command ) 
        - Eg 1  _gateway (10.0.2.2)  498.967 ms  499.457 ms  499.320 ms ( last three time shows from a to b to a time ) 
        - traceroute -p  port-number ip ( Default port number is 33434 somethinng to change it use this ) 
        - traceroute -4 | 6 ip ( To use ipv4 or ipv6 address ) 
        - traceroute -g your_ip ip  ( To route through gate )

  3. Netstat
  
     Install it & switch to root 
     Netstate is command-line network utility that diplays
      
      - Network connection for tcp udp
      - routing tables 
      - a number of network interface 
      - network protocol statics 
      
      
     Case : 
       
      - To identify no of coneection on give port or IP 
        - netstat -putan | grep port/IP   (putan - process udp tcp all & numeric )
        
        - netstat | more ( Limited info means active one ) 
        - netstat -a | more ( to see connection including tcp & udp )
        - netstat -at | more ( to see tcp protocol only ) 
        - netstat -au | more ( '' )
        - netstat -at6 | more ( to see tcp version 6 v6 | 4 to v4 )
        - netstat -l | more ( to see only who are listening ) 
        - netstat -ln | more ( to see numerical addrs of local address ) 
        
          Example :netstat -al | more
           Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
tcp        0      0 _localdnsstub:domain    0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:http            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 _localdnsproxy:domain   0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 localhost:ipp           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        1      0 maroof-56-Virtual:53588 123.35.104.34.bc.g:http CLOSE_WAIT 
tcp        0      0 maroof-56-Virtual:35992 213.238.236.35.bc:https ESTABLISHED

        - Below local address there is name of every address 
        
        
        - Example : netstate -ln | more 
           roto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.53:53           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.54:53           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:631           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN     
tcp6       0      0 ::1:631                 :::*                    LISTEN    

        - Below local address u will see the numerical adress of every name 
        
        - netstat -p | more (  To view the PID of programme of connection means konse program ki wajah se ye port run ho ra h ) & netstat -lnp (it also works )
        
        - netstat -r ( To view the routing table ) 
        
        - netstat -i (  To see the list of all interface ) 
        
        - netstat -ap | grep process_name ( Which port a process is using ) 
        
        - netstat -s  ( to see statics means list of ip , tcp , udp & so on )
